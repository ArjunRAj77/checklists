# PHP Development Checklist

## Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Variables**:
  - [ ] Use `camelCase` for variable names.
  - [ ] Use descriptive names that convey the purpose.

- [ ] **Functions and Methods**:
  - [ ] Use `camelCase` for function and method names.
  - [ ] Use verbs to describe what the function or method does (e.g., `getUser`, `setConfiguration`).

- [ ] **Classes**:
  - [ ] Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - [ ] Use nouns or noun phrases for class names.

- [ ] **Constants**:
  - [ ] Use `ALL_CAPS` for constant names.
  - [ ] Use underscores to separate words in constant names.

## Script Structure

- [ ] **File Organization**:
  - [ ] Organize files into logical directories (e.g., `src`, `tests`, `config`, `public`).
  - [ ] Example:
    ```
    my_project/
        ├── src/
        │   ├── Controller/
        │   │   ├── UserController.php
        │   ├── Model/
        │   │   ├── User.php
        │   ├── View/
        │   │   ├── user.php
        ├── tests/
        │   ├── UserControllerTest.php
        ├── config/
        │   ├── database.php
        ├── public/
        │   ├── index.php
        ├── .gitignore
        ├── README.md
        ├── composer.json
    ```

- [ ] **Namespaces**:
  - [ ] Use namespaces to organize classes logically.
  - [ ] Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards.

- [ ] **Headers and Comments**:
  - [ ] Include a comment block at the top of each file with the file's purpose, author, date, and version.
  - [ ] Example:
    ```php
    <?php
    /**
     * User Controller
     *
     * Handles user-related operations.
     *
     * @author Author Name
     * @date YYYY-MM-DD
     * @version 1.0
     */
    ```

## Code Style

- [ ] **Code Conventions**:
  - [ ] Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards.
  - [ ] Use an IDE with built-in style checking, such as PHPStorm or Visual Studio Code.

- [ ] **DocBlocks**:
  - [ ] Use PHPDoc comments for all classes, methods, and functions.
  - [ ] Include proper tags (e.g., `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`).

- [ ] **Code Formatting**:
  - [ ] Use a code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
  - [ ] Configure the formatter in your IDE or use a build tool plugin.

## Project Requirements

- [ ] **Dependencies**:
  - [ ] List all dependencies in `composer.json`.
  - [ ] Use specific version numbers to avoid compatibility issues.

- [ ] **Composer**:
  - [ ] Use Composer for dependency management.
  - [ ] Run `composer install` to install dependencies.

## Testing

- [ ] **Test Coverage**:
  - [ ] Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
  - [ ] Use a testing framework like PHPUnit.

- [ ] **Continuous Integration**:
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing.
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass before merging code changes.

## Documentation

- [ ] **README File**:
  - [ ] Include a comprehensive README with installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

- [ ] **Inline Documentation**:
  - [ ] Use inline comments and PHPDoc comments for functions and key logic.

## Version Control

- [ ] **Git Usage**:
  - [ ] Use meaningful commit messages.
  - [ ] Commit code frequently with small, logical changes.

- [ ] **Branching Strategy**:
  - [ ] Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
  - [ ] Create feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

## Code Review

- [ ] **Pull Requests**:
  - [ ] Submit code changes through pull requests (PRs).
  - [ ] Request code reviews from team members.

- [ ] **Review Process**:
  - [ ] Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
  - [ ] Ensure code meets project standards before approving PRs.

## Security

- [ ] **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
  - [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
  - [ ] Use prepared statements for database queries.

- [ ] **Sensitive Information**:
  - [ ] Do not hard-code sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) in the codebase.
  - [ ] Use environment variables or secure methods for storing and accessing sensitive information.

- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - [ ] Use try-catch blocks for error handling.
  - [ ] Log errors instead of displaying them to users.
