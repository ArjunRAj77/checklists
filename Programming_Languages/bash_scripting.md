# Bash Scripting Checklist

## Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Variables**:
  - [ ] Use `snake_case` for variable names.
  - [ ] Use descriptive names that convey the purpose.
  - [ ] Use all uppercase for environment variables and constants.

- [ ] **Functions**:
  - [ ] Use `snake_case` for function names.
  - [ ] Use verbs to describe what the function does (e.g., `backup_files`, `generate_report`).

## Script Structure

- [ ] **Script Header**:
  - [ ] Include a comment block at the top with the script's purpose, author, date, and version.
  - [ ] Example:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # 
    # Script Name: my_script.sh
    # Description: Brief description of the script.
    # Author: Author Name
    # Date: YYYY-MM-DD
    # Version: 1.0
    ```

- [ ] **Environment Setup**:
  - [ ] Use `set -e` to exit the script on any command failure.
  - [ ] Use `set -u` to treat unset variables as an error.

- [ ] **Parameter Handling**:
  - [ ] Use `getopts` for parsing command-line arguments.
  - [ ] Provide usage information for the script.

- [ ] **Functions and Main Execution**:
  - [ ] Define functions at the beginning of the script.
  - [ ] Use a main function to encapsulate the main script logic.
  - [ ] Call the main function at the end of the script.

## Code Style

- [ ] **Indentation and Spacing**:
  - [ ] Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces).
  - [ ] Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

- [ ] **Commenting**:
  - [ ] Comment on complex logic and key sections of the script.
  - [ ] Use single-line comments (`#`) and multi-line comments (`: ' ... '`).

- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - [ ] Check the return status of commands using `$?`.
  - [ ] Provide meaningful error messages and exit codes.

- [ ] **Output and Logging**:
  - [ ] Use `echo` or `printf` for normal output.
  - [ ] Use `>&2` for error messages.
  - [ ] Include a logging mechanism if necessary.

## Project Requirements

- [ ] **Dependencies**:
  - [ ] List all required external commands and dependencies.
  - [ ] Include installation instructions for dependencies.

- [ ] **Script Configuration**:
  - [ ] Use configuration files (e.g., `.conf`, `.env`) for script settings if applicable.
  - [ ] Load configurations at the start of the script.

## Testing

- [ ] **Test Scripts**:
  - [ ] Write test scripts for all functions and key logic.
  - [ ] Use a testing framework like `bats` for automated testing.

- [ ] **Continuous Integration**:
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing.
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass before merging code changes.

## Documentation

- [ ] **README File**:
  - [ ] Include a comprehensive README with installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

- [ ] **Inline Documentation**:
  - [ ] Use inline comments and help documentation (`#` and `: ' ... '`) for functions and important sections.

## Version Control

- [ ] **Git Usage**:
  - [ ] Use meaningful commit messages.
  - [ ] Commit code frequently with small, logical changes.

- [ ] **Branching Strategy**:
  - [ ] Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
  - [ ] Create feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

## Code Review

- [ ] **Pull Requests**:
  - [ ] Submit code changes through pull requests (PRs).
  - [ ] Request code reviews from team members.

- [ ] **Review Process**:
  - [ ] Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
  - [ ] Ensure code meets project standards before approving PRs.

## Security

- [ ] **Sensitive Information**:
  - [ ] Do not hard-code sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) in the script.
  - [ ] Use environment variables or secure methods for storing and accessing sensitive information.

- [ ] **Script Permissions**:
  - [ ] Set appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 700 script.sh`).
  - [ ] Avoid using `sudo` within the script unless absolutely necessary.

- [ ] **Command Injection**:
  - [ ] Validate and sanitize all input to avoid command injection.
  - [ ] Use double quotes around variable expansions to prevent word splitting and globbing.
