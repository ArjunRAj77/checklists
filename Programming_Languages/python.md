# Python Development Checklist

## Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Variables and Functions**:
  - [ ] Use `snake_case` for variable and function names.
  - [ ] Use descriptive names that convey the purpose.

- [ ] **Classes**:
  - [ ] Use `CamelCase` for class names.
  - [ ] Use nouns or noun phrases for class names.

- [ ] **Constants**:
  - [ ] Use `ALL_CAPS` for constant names.
  - [ ] Place constants in a separate module or at the top of a file.

## Project Structure

- [ ] **Directory Layout**:
  - [ ] Use a standard project layout:
    ```
    my_project/
        ├── my_module/
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── submodule.py
        ├── tests/
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── test_submodule.py
        ├── .gitignore
        ├── README.md
        ├── requirements.txt
        ├── setup.py
    ```

- [ ] **Modularity**:
  - [ ] Break the project into smaller, reusable modules.
  - [ ] Each module should have a single responsibility.

## Code Style

- [ ] **PEP 8 Compliance**:
  - [ ] Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines.
  - [ ] Use linters like `flake8` or `pylint`.

- [ ] **Docstrings**:
  - [ ] Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
  - [ ] Use triple double quotes for docstrings.

- [ ] **Comments**:
  - [ ] Use comments to explain why code exists, not what it does.
  - [ ] Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.

## Project Requirements

- [ ] **Dependencies**:
  - [ ] List all dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.
  - [ ] Use specific version numbers to avoid compatibility issues.

- [ ] **Virtual Environment**:
  - [ ] Use a virtual environment (`venv` or `virtualenv`) for the project.
  - [ ] Activate the virtual environment before installing dependencies.

## Testing

- [ ] **Test Coverage**:
  - [ ] Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
  - [ ] Use a testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest`.

- [ ] **Continuous Integration**:
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) for automated testing.
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass before merging code changes.

## Documentation

- [ ] **README File**:
  - [ ] Include a comprehensive README with installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

- [ ] **API Documentation**:
  - [ ] Generate API documentation using tools like `Sphinx` or `MkDocs`.
  - [ ] Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

## Version Control

- [ ] **Git Usage**:
  - [ ] Use meaningful commit messages.
  - [ ] Commit code frequently with small, logical changes.

- [ ] **Branching Strategy**:
  - [ ] Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
  - [ ] Create feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

## Code Review

- [ ] **Pull Requests**:
  - [ ] Submit code changes through pull requests (PRs).
  - [ ] Request code reviews from team members.

- [ ] **Review Process**:
  - [ ] Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
  - [ ] Ensure code meets project standards before approving PRs.

## Security

- [ ] **Dependencies**:
  - [ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Use tools like `bandit` to check for security issues.

- [ ] **Secrets Management**:
  - [ ] Do not hard-code secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords) in the codebase.
  - [ ] Use environment variables or secret management tools.
