# PowerShell Scripting Checklist

## Naming Conventions

- [ ] **Variables**:
  - [ ] Use `camelCase` for variable names.
  - [ ] Use descriptive names that convey the purpose.

- [ ] **Functions**:
  - [ ] Use `PascalCase` for function names.
  - [ ] Use a verb-noun pair for function names (e.g., `Get-User`, `Set-Configuration`).

- [ ] **Constants**:
  - [ ] Use `ALL_CAPS` for constant names.
  - [ ] Use underscores to separate words in constant names.

## Script Structure

- [ ] **Script Header**:
  - [ ] Include a comment block at the top with the script's purpose, author, date, and version.
  - [ ] Example:
    ```powershell
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Brief description of the script.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Detailed description of the script.
    .PARAMETER ParameterName
        Description of the parameter.
    .EXAMPLE
        Example of how to use the script.
    .NOTES
        Additional notes.
    .AUTHOR
        Author name
    .DATE
        Date
    .VERSION
        Version number
    #>
    ```

- [ ] **Parameter Declarations**:
  - [ ] Use `[CmdletBinding()]` and `param()` to declare parameters.
  - [ ] Include parameter attributes like `[Parameter()]`, `[ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]`.

- [ ] **Regions**:
  - [ ] Use regions to organize code into logical sections (e.g., `#region Variables`, `#region Functions`).

## Code Style

- [ ] **Indentation and Spacing**:
  - [ ] Use consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces).
  - [ ] Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

- [ ] **Commenting**:
  - [ ] Comment on complex logic and key sections of the script.
  - [ ] Use single-line comments (`#`) and multi-line comments (`<# ... #>`).

- [ ] **Error Handling**:
  - [ ] Use `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks for error handling.
  - [ ] Include meaningful error messages.

- [ ] **Output and Logging**:
  - [ ] Use `Write-Output` for normal output.
  - [ ] Use `Write-Error`, `Write-Warning`, and `Write-Verbose` for logging messages.
  - [ ] Include a logging mechanism if necessary.

## Project Requirements

- [ ] **Modules and Dependencies**:
  - [ ] List all required modules and dependencies.
  - [ ] Include installation instructions for dependencies.

- [ ] **Script Configuration**:
  - [ ] Use configuration files (e.g., JSON, XML) for script settings if applicable.
  - [ ] Load configurations at the start of the script.

## Testing

- [ ] **Test Scripts**:
  - [ ] Write test scripts for all functions and key logic.
  - [ ] Use a testing framework like `Pester` for automated testing.

- [ ] **Continuous Integration**:
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing.
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass before merging code changes.

## Documentation

- [ ] **README File**:
  - [ ] Include a comprehensive README with installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

- [ ] **Inline Documentation**:
  - [ ] Use inline comments and help documentation (`<# ... #>`) for functions.

## Version Control

- [ ] **Git Usage**:
  - [ ] Use meaningful commit messages.
  - [ ] Commit code frequently with small, logical changes.

- [ ] **Branching Strategy**:
  - [ ] Use a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
  - [ ] Create feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

## Code Review

- [ ] **Pull Requests**:
  - [ ] Submit code changes through pull requests (PRs).
  - [ ] Request code reviews from team members.

- [ ] **Review Process**:
  - [ ] Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
  - [ ] Ensure code meets project standards before approving PRs.

## Security

- [ ] **Sensitive Information**:
  - [ ] Do not hard-code sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) in the script.
  - [ ] Use secure methods for storing and accessing sensitive information.

- [ ] **Script Execution Policy**:
  - [ ] Set the appropriate execution policy (e.g., `RemoteSigned`, `AllSigned`).
  - [ ] Ensure scripts are signed if required.
